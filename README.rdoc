http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection

== Install

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install feature_selection
  
== How To Use

There are currently 3 implemented feature collections: Chi-Squared, Mutual Information and Frequency Based.

Each return a hash that looks similar to:

  {klass => {term => score, term => score}, klass => {term => score}}
  
Example:

  data = {
          :spam => [['this', 'is', 'some', 'information'], ['this', 'is', 'something', 'that', 'is', 'information']],
          :ham => [['this', 'test', 'some', 'more', 'information'], ['there', 'are', 'some', 'things']],
          }

  a = FeatureSelection::ChiSquared.new(data)

  # You can also use...
  # FeatureSelection::MutualInformation
  # FeatureSelection::FrequencyBased

  a.rank_features
    #=> {:spam => {term => score, term => score}, :ham => {term => score}}
